        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>For the past couple of years, I've been making photography zines (<a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/f2e5b164d0.html">1</a>, <a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/69f3f2b02c.html">2</a>).  'Zine' is short for magazine and it's typically a way for artists to make limited, hand crafted or digital editions of their work.</p>

            <p>I got into photography in high school and since then, I've consistently taken pictures on my phone, edited them in Lightroom, and then used InDesign to make zines.</p>

            <p>I've explored doing photography or videography for pay but I didn't like it all. There are many easy opportunities where I could justsetup a tripod, record something, and get paid X amount of dollars. But, it just doesn't fulfill me. I view hobbies as ways to have fun. There's also the added pressure and work of dealing with clients, payments, and managing expectations which I don't want to deal with when it comes to photography.</p>

            <p>Thankfully, I find making zines fun. Being able to take photos, edit them how I want, and have full creative freedom is a great feeling. Through this process, I've most likely learned more and been more creative by playing around compared to doing easy gigs and trying to impress clients.</p>

            <p>Maybe one day I'll do graduation photos or make a film of Ryan and Nancy's wedding but for now, I'm going to stick to my zines.</p>

            <p>My latest zine, Golden, is going to be released soon. It's my favorite photos from the full year I was 20 years old.</p>
