        <h1>Winter Classes</h1>
        <p class="date">January 20, 2024</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Some classes should be done in a shorter time frame</p>
        
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>I recently completed a winter class, <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA23/class/ENTOM/2030">ENTOM 2030</a> which is the study of honey bees. I honestly feel like a lot of classes outside of math, physics, and computer science can be completed in this format and that there is no need for many classes to be dragged out to a full semester.</p>

            <p>Data structures and algorithms, Calculus, and classes along those lines should be done synchronously and over a semester. However, I've taken many classes in college across biology, anthropology, and other humanities subjects that could have been done in shorter time frames.</p>
            
            <p>If winter and summer classes weren't so expensive, I would recommend students look into them to get through general education classes. Then during the semester, students could take fewer classes overall, focus on their STEM classes, and have more time for extracurriculars.</p>
            
            <p>Also, it's a great way to go through content. I was forced to engage with the material for multiple hours every day so I feel like I will retain more long term.</p>
