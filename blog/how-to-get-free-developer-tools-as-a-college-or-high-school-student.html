If you're a high school or college student, you have to take advantage of the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

## What Is It
After confirming eligibility and enrollment, Github gives you free access to tons of different resources that you can use for personal projects or even projects that you want to sell.

## Building A Project With The Perks
The best way to demonstrate the value of the student developer pack is to go through a sample project with the perks given.

Let's say you want to build the next great to-do list app, here's how the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) can help you:

### IDE
[Jetbrains makes great IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/ides/) for languages and as a student, you get free access to their software. If you're writing Python, there's PyCharm, IntelliJ for Java, and many other IDEs for other languages and tooling.

### Learning Resources
Before diving into the project, if you want to get up to speed with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other modern frameworks, you get access to the following platforms which have programming lessons:
- Educative 
	- "Dive into 6 months of free access to over 70 practical courses, covering hot topics like Web Development, Python, Java, and Machine Learning. Plus, students enjoy an awesome 30% discount on any subscription they pick!"

### Domain Names
After you come up with an amazing name for your new killer app, you're going to want a memorable domain name. Github gives you three different options to choose from in this category:
- .tech Domains
	- "A powerful domain extension to convey that you belong to the technology industry. One standard .TECH domain free for 1 year."
